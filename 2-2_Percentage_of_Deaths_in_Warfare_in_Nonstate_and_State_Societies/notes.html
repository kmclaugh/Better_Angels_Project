<p>This graph shows the number of deaths due to war (or violence) divided by the number of deaths from non-violent causes. It answers the question "What are the chances that a person died at the hands of another person rather than passing away of natural causes?"</p>

<p>The graph demonstrates that, contrary to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage">noble savage</a> myth, members of state societies of any era are much less likely to die from violence than members of non-state societies. The first group, Prehistoric Archaeological Sites, shows the rate of violent death for skeletons dug out of archaeological sites. The second group, Hunter-gathers, is pulled from ethnographic evidence of more recent hunter-gather societies. The third group, Hunter-horticultururalists and Other Tribal Groups, is from ethnographic evidence of recent societies that engage in hunting, gathering, and horticulture. The final group shows State societies from pre-Columbian Mexico up to the modern day. While Ancient Mexico and certain periods of western history are certainly violent compared to today, all state societies are drastically less violent than almost all of the non-state societies. Pinker estimates that, holding many factors constant, living in a state society reduces your chance of dying a violent death fivefold.</p>
