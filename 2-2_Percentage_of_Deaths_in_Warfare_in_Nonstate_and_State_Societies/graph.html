            var graph_note = '<p>This graph shows the number of deaths due to war (or violence) divided by the number of deaths from non-violent causes. It answers the question "What are the chances that a person died at the hands of another person rather than passing away of natural causes?"</p> <p>The graph demonstrates that, contrary to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage">noble savage</a> myth, members of state societies of any era are much less likely to die from violence than members of non-state societies. The first group, Prehistoric Archaeological Sites, shows the rate of violent death for skeletons dug out of archaeological sites. The second group, Hunter-gathers, is pulled from ethnographic evidence of more recent hunter-gather societies. The third group, Hunter-horticultururalists and Other Tribal Groups, is from ethnographic evidence of recent societies that engage in hunting, gathering, and horticulture. The final group shows State societies from pre-Columbian Mexico up to the modern day. While Ancient Mexico and certain periods of western history are certainly violent compared to today, all state societies are drastically less violent than almost all of the non-state societies. Pinker estimates that, holding many factors constant, living in a state society reduces your chance of dying a violent death fivefold.</p>';

The first edition was completed in November 1941, before World War IIs most destructive years. The figure was unchanged, however, in the 1965 revision, page 245, and in the 1964 abridgment, page 60, though the latter mentions Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki in the same paragraph. Pinker assumes the unchanged estimate was intentional, and that the additional world war deaths were offset by the billion people added to the world during the more fecund and less lethal postwar decades.</p> <p>The world-wide total battle deaths in the 20th Century are summed for the years 1900 through 1945 inclusive from the three <a href="http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/COW-war"><em>Correlates of War</em></a> datasets (Inter-State, Extrastate, and Intrastate), using the larger figure of the two columns "State Deaths" and "Total Deaths", together with the geometric mean of the "Battle Dead Low" and "Battle Dead High" estimates for the years 1946 to 2000 inclusive from the <a href="https://www.prio.org/Data/Armed-Conflict/Battle-Deaths/The-Battle-Deaths-Dataset-version-30/"><em>PRIO Battle Deaths</em></a> Dataset.</p> <p>The 6 billion total deaths denominator used in both the <em>World (wars and genocides) 20th Century</em> and <em>World (battle deaths) 20th Century<em> figures comes from <a href="http://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/SECSTUD.PDF">John Muellers</a> estimate that 12 billion people lived in the 20th century and that about 5.75 billion were alive at the centurys end.</p> <p>According to the the <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/"><em>Statistical Abstract of the United States</em></a>, 2,448,017 Americans died in 2005. According to <a href="http://icasualties.org/"><em>icasualties.org</em></a> there were 846 American battle deaths in Iraq and 99 in Afghanistan. </p> ';
